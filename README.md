# CodeCampWIN
The Time Wanderer (School project) - A small 2D Rogue-Like made with Unity in 2 weeks

#Controls
- Arrow keys to move
- S to use the sword
- A to shoot
- Shift to run (requires powerup)
- Tab to change gravity (requires powerup, and it's buggued iirc)

#Currently working :

- All the maps are into the game, but no enemies in zone 3/4, and zone 3 boss is still a WIP
- Zone 1 and 2 enemies are done. Even if we may or may not add some more in zone 2
- Zone 1 and 2 are complete (except for sound effects, and we can still add maps)
- Run and Double Jump are working
- Boss 1 and 2 are working
- Portals are working. And random generation too.

#Needs to be fixed :
- One portal exit in zone 3 is bad
- One portal exit in zone 1 is forcing you to lose time if you want to go to left
- Putting the mobs we finished/almost finished in zone 3
- Music bug (maybe?)
- Finishing boss 3 and removing the script in his room that makes everything bug
- Platforms/player hitbox
- Some platforms are without the Platform tag

#Needs to be done :

- Zone 3 enemies
- Zone 4 enemies
- Zone 4 boss
- Zone 4 powerup
- Changing damage/armor when you beat a boss (?)
- True menu/game over/credits
- Gamepad inputs
- Sound effects
- More maps, maybe
